        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)
        * Google CS First <a href="https://www.cs-first.com/training/introduction-computer-science-and-scratch">Training Materials</a>
        * Teachers Learning Code <a href="http://teacherslearningcode.com/assets/TLC-gettingstartedguide.pdf">Guide</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome girls and boys to our Kids Learning Code workshop: Artmaking with Scratch [Halloween Edition]! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 29 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        #Code-Along

        Have everyone open up Scratch. Click on “create” (top left corner), then on “tips” in the top toolbar. Choose a Code-Along activity from the Scratch Tips project list, under the “Step-by-Step” tab. Suggested activity: “Animate Your Name.” Go through the steps as learners follow along on their own screens. This is a chance for learners to become familiar with the tool, and begin exploring how the different blocks work.

        #Work Session

        ##Ages 6-8 + parents

        Choose <strong>one</strong> activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13vVx3XwkvJuRs2ca2GVvLuixVlIkXkzbRYdzA14aOi8/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>(artmaking tab). <strong>Halloween activity: Ghosts!</strong>. Show learners where to find the <strong>starter project</strong> in the class folder. Follow the <strong>solution sheet</strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right before the “Add-On” portion. Then, give time for learners to remix the project on their own. It might be helpful to brainstorm remix ideas for inspiration (refer to “Add-On” ideas). Leave time at the end for learners to test their games and share their projects with each other.

        In order to encourage learners and parents to work together as a cohesive team, it might be helpful to clarify roles during the activities. For example, after putting together a few lines of code, the parent can be the ‘tester’ and the learner the ‘de-bugger’: problem-solving to find solutions to any buggy code. Alternatively, the parent can verbalize each step of code while the learner searches for the relevant block. Ideally, the learner is in charge of navigating and completing tasks on the computer, while the parent supports them.

        ##Ages 9-12

        Choose <strong>two</strong> activities from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13vVx3XwkvJuRs2ca2GVvLuixVlIkXkzbRYdzA14aOi8/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>(artmaking tab). <strong>Halloween activities: Ghosts! and Costume App</strong>. Show learners where to find the <strong>starter projects</strong> in the class folder. Follow the <strong>solution sheet</strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right before the “Add-On” portion. Then, give time for learners to remix the project on their own. It might be helpful to brainstorm remix ideas for inspiration (refer to “Add-On” ideas). Leave time at the end for learners to test their games and share their projects with each other.

        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
